There is a direct financial impact such as theft of confidential information, disruption to trading or even having to repair affected systems all resulting in financial loss. Additionally, cybersecurity breaches also cause reputational damage which sometimes has far bigger impact than just the financial loss and can be fatal to an organization.\nThe moment an application is deployed to production, new security holes and zero-day exploits make the Application vulnerable despite all the efforts of the pre-production testing. In a siloed world where Security Team is focussed on Vulnerabilities and Threats, and App Team is focussed on Application Topologies, Savi (Sr. Director, Cyberdefense, Bridge to Possibili-Tea) wondered if it was possible to have a Security Solution that could bring multiple teams together and reduce MTTD and the MTTR, while having the business risk in mind as well.\nA New Approach With applications running anywhere, changing constantly, and being unique, Savi needed to take a new approach to security. She wanted a solution that offers ‘Inside-Out Security’. It should:\n Be closer to the application runtime Continuously evaluate the Application for security Share context with different teams based on metrices from Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Business Intelligence (BiQ) Assess which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk to the organization and prioritize vulnerability remediation based on that business risk.

	"content": " Introduction Savi (Sr. Director, Cyberdefense, Bridge to Possibili-Tea), is well aware of the penalty for a security breach. A lack of focus on cybersecurity can be incredibly damaging to her organization. There is a direct economic impact such as theft of confidential information, disruption to trading or even having to repair affected systems all resulting in financial loss. Additionally, cybersecurity breaches also cause reputational damage which sometimes has far bigger impact than just the financial loss.\nSavi can’t get back the time it takes her team to detect and contain an active breach. Rather than just saying “I found something at this URL, can you fix it?”, Savi wanted to go to the DevOps team with exact data points and tell them – “I found vulnerability CVE–XXXX-XXXXX in the ‘Checkout’ Service Tier of the Application ‘TeaStore’; here is the details of the vulnerability with adversary tactics and techniques; this is how bad (severe) it is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score; this is the likelihood of exploitation based on real-time events (Kenna); you can prioritize remediations based on the impact a vulnerability has on important business transactions, and here are the remediation steps.” This kind of information can be a huge time saver for the DevOps team.\nSavi and her team want to work and solve the following pain points:\n Reduce the time to detection from days/months to minutes Protect the application against attacks in real time Identify vulnerabilities and threats within the applications in production and suggest suitable remediation steps Reduce the attack surface by collaborating efficiently with other teams to fix the vulnerabilities and mitigate the threats To share the security context that will help in prioritizing remediation tasks based on business impact  \nNext \u0026nbsp; We\u0026rsquo;ll look at how Cisco Secure Application helps Savi sleep in peace with confidence.\n\n"

	"content": " Why Cisco Secure Application? After evaluating many Application Security products, Savi and her team decided to implement Cisco Secure Application because of these reasons:\n\u0026nbsp; Runtime detection\nTypically, vulnerability scanning is done pre-production or scheduled monthly/quarterly etc. But Cisco Secure Application provides real-time production assessment of vulnerabilities by scanning code execution to prevent exploits regardless of where the application is hosted or where the traffic originated and then maps them back to the running instances. It detects application code dependency and security vulnerabilities in production. The business can operate at a faster pace with a lower risk profile due to constant run-time protection, real-time remediation, and security automation.\n\u0026nbsp; Significant reduction in MTTD and MTTR\nProtection at runtime gives visibility into application\u0026rsquo;s true behaviour and you can catch zero-day exploits in minutes and not in weeks/months. It gives the details of vulnerabilities, their severity levels, the remediation steps that includes the details of the running part of the code that is vulnerable and what to change to mitigate the risk. This reduces the Mean Time to Detection from days/weeks to minutes and helps in drastically reducing the time it takes to remediate.\n\u0026nbsp; Automatic \u0026amp; continuous\nIt simplifies the life cycle of vulnerability fixes and security incidents. New discoveries and resolutions are tracked and reported without having to wait.\n\u0026nbsp; Strategic prioritization based on Business Impact\nVulnerability data is correlated to the application and business context so that application and security teams can prioritize, execute, and track remediation by business impact. Rather than just using a static Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to measure the severity of a vulnerability, customers can also use Business Risk Observability (BRO), which provides an intelligent assessment of business risk based on a combination of factors such as the likelihood of exploitation, the impact of the vulnerability on critical business transactions, third-party API vulnerabilities, etc.\n\u0026nbsp; No more siloed teams\nWith Secure Application, application and security teams can leverage correlated performance and security insights to minimize their organization’s attack surface, safeguard customer data, keep business impact and objectives top of mind, and thrive in today’s digital environment.\n\u0026nbsp; Secures modern applications without sacrificing velocity\nSecure Application reduces the risk of security exposure without compromising the speed of delivery.\n\u0026nbsp; Anomaly detection and prevention\nProvides visibility into Application’s true behaviour and detects deviations from the normal. Automatically enforces security policies to block the threats.\n\u0026nbsp; No additional Agent\nThere is no need of deploying any additional agent (It’s embedded into existing APM agent). It has negligible overhead and doesn’t impact end-users.\n\u0026nbsp; Works with existing Security Solutions\nIt compliments existing security products such as WAFs, NGWAFs etc. and works well with products like Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics, Cisco Secure Workload and Cisco Secure Access (Duo) to protect the Application from \u0026lsquo;Inside\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Outside\u0026rsquo;.\nSecure Application delivers substantial value to the Organizations by pairing AppDynamics with the strength Cisco has in the security market, making security an integral part of the enterprise application monitoring strategy. It extends the current performance monitoring capabilities of AppDynamics to provide continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities, runtime detection of exploits, and real-time defense against a broad range of attacks.\nThanks to Secure Application, Savi’s organisation Bridge to Possibili-Tea can protect applications at runtime, detect and block attacks in real-time, and simplify the lifecycle of security incidents by providing application and business context and creating a shared context across Application and Security teams to drastically reduce the MTTD and MTTR. Application Team can now scope a security incident and understand the potential impact to users and the business and strategically prioritize remediationby business impact.\n\nNext \u0026nbsp; We\u0026rsquo;ll look at the lab environment and how Cisco Secure Application fits in.\n\n"

Ali wants to be comfortable while navigating the Dashboard so he knows what kind of information is readily available to him.\n\nAppDynamics Application Dashboard \u0026nbsp; Use the steps below to navigate to your TeaStore application.\n Click on the Applications tab on the top menu Find your TeaStore application with your lab number in the name and click on its name to open it  \u0026nbsp; The Application Dashboard displays showing the components that comprise the TeaStore application.\n The Security Health widget displays the Business Risk Score in real time, the number of vulnerabilities divided by criticality, and the number of attacks that either compromised the security of your application, were blocked by the CSA attack policy, or the malicious activity was detected but not exploited. Click on the Security Health link to launch the Secure Application dashboard  \nCSA Home Dashboard \u0026nbsp; The Home page provides a high-level overview of Attacks and Vulnerabilities of the monitored application.\n Navigate to the Home page by clicking the Home tab on the top menu\n The Business Transactions pane shows the number of business transactions based on their risk status detected, alongside the daily Busines Risk Score, and Top Recommended Actions.\n There are 3 business risk statuses based on the score:  Normal: 0-330 \u0026nbsp; Warning: 340-660 \u0026nbsp; Critical: 670-1000   The Vulnerabilities pane shows the number of both Open and Fixed vulnerabilities.\n The chart in the left represents the total number of vulnerabilities based on their risk score. The color of the chart displays the number of vulnerabilities for different severity levels:  Critical = Red \u0026nbsp; High = Orange \u0026nbsp; Medium = Yellow \u0026nbsp; Low = Purple  Severity Trend shows the number of security vulnerabilities by severity in a given period. Days Since First Detected shows the number of days since the vulnerability has been open and its severity level.   \u0026nbsp; Scroll down the screen to see the Attacks and Applications pane.\n The Attacks pane displays the number of Attacks by Outcome, Top Applications and Top Attack Types.\n The chart on the left shows the total number of Open attacks and their states:  Exploited = Red \u0026nbsp; Blocked = Purple \u0026nbsp; Attempted = Yellow  Top Attack Types displays the top 10 attack events in different states (exploited, blocked or attempted)   The Applications pane displays the nodes of the application in question and the trend\n Total Active Nodes Total number of APM nodes that are registered and active in the AppDynamics controller.

	"content": " Introduction In the previous lab \u0026lsquo;Understanding Security State of an Application\u0026rsquo; you obtained some actionable information and learned how the Dashboard made it easy to understand the state of an application. You will explore this further in the following lab (\u0026lsquo;Business Risk Profiling and Prioritization\u0026rsquo;). But now that you know you have some open vulnerabilities that carry critical and high severity levels, your immediate priority should be to make sure adversaries are not able to exploit these vulnerabilities or do any further damage.\n\nLearning Objectives In this lab you will:\n Detect if the vulnerability (log4j CVE-2021-44228) is actually present in the application If it is, block the attacks without even updating the code or restarting the app Confirm that the attacks are being blocked  \nVulnerabilities Dashboard \u0026nbsp; Use the steps you used previously to navigate to the Secure Application Dashboard if you\u0026rsquo;ve been logged out.\n\u0026nbsp; Navigate go to the Vulnerabilities tab as shown below to find out if the vulnerability (log4j CVE-2021-44228) is present in your TeaStore application.\n Click on the Vulnerabilities tab that shows number of Open vulnerabilities, their severity levels and lifespans In this column you see the specific types of vulnerabilities that have been detected Look at the Kenna Score that provides an estimate of exploitation likelihood for each vulnerability. See Vulnerability Scoring in Kenna for more details about the scoring mechanism. Note if there is an exclamation point in the Reached column indicating that the vulnerable code has been reached In the Application column, you can see the application that is vulnerable (in this case, it is only your TeaStore application, since you have limited the scope). The columns next to it indicate the exact application tier and library associated with the vulnerability, which makes it easier for application maintainers to proceed with remediation. The Status column tells us if a particular vulnerability has been Detected, Confirmed, Fixed, Ignored, or Not Vulnerable  \u0026nbsp; Next, look at the specific vulnerability you are interested in and focus on Detecting it and then Preventing attackers from exploiting it.\n Select ID from the filter box drop-down  Type in the string 44228 Select CVE-2021-44228 from the drop-down  This confirms a Critical vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) is present in your application You can observe the affected services or Tiers in the application that are vulnerable The CVSS Score of 10.0 indicates that this vulnerability has a critical severity level The Kenna Score of 100 means Ali needs to do something urgently as it is highly probable that this vulnerability will be exploited soon  In general, you should focus more on the Kenna score than the CVSS score, because a low severity vulnerability (CVSS) may bring a high exploitation risk (Kenna) to your environment, while a high severity vulnerability may have little impact on the security of your application  Click on the CVE-2021-44228 link under ID column, taking you to the vulnerability detail page  \u0026nbsp; Now you can see more detail about the vulnerability and possible remediation steps for it.\n The Kenna Score widget provides some real-time details about whether this vulnerability is part of an active internet breach, whether it is easily exploitable, whether it is a popular target, and so on.  It describes how attackers exploit this vulnerability and further detail on suggested remediation steps  The Overview box gives an overview of this vulnerability. Scroll down the overview box to learn more.  It describes how attackers exploit this vulnerability and further detail on suggested remediation steps  The Details section provides some details about the vulnerabilities, such as when the vulnerability was first published, when it first appeared in your application, as well as some suggestions for fixing the vulnerability by updating the affected library. You can click on the external link next to CVE-2021-44228 in the ID area  This will take you to the NIST website where you can learn more about this vulnerability (as seen in the next image)   \u0026nbsp; Example of the NIST website for CVE-2021-44228\n\nAttacks Dashboard Now that you know that there is a vulnerability in your environment and how severe it is, you should make sure that the application is protected against this vulnerability. A Policy within CSA to block the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability was created previously.\n\u0026nbsp; The following steps will reveal how the policy was created.\n Click on the cogwheel button in the upper right corner of the Secure Application screen Select Policies from the drop-down\n  \u0026nbsp; Look for your application\u0026rsquo;s policy and check its settings.\n In the search bar, select Application as the search parameter and enter the name of your application, which you will find in the upper right corner A single Network or socket access policy should appear, with a custom rule that blocks the attack if the application stack trace contains a malicious call to the Jndi lookup method in the log4j library  Next, make sure this policy is doing it\u0026rsquo;s job and blocking the attacks.\n\u0026nbsp; Use the steps below to look at the details of the blocked CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.\n Click on the Attacks tab at the top of the Secure Application screen Select Outcome from the filter box drop-down  Then select Blocked from the box drop-down The screen will be populated with all the Attacks that have been Blocked  Click on the first attack in the list  \u0026nbsp; Now you are looking at the Attack Details screen.\n Observe the Timestamp and the Affected Node Look at the vulnerability details such as:  the attack Entry Point, which is the webserver URL accessed by the client in the transaction that triggered the event Blocked Reason is the reason why the blocked event was triggered Socket Out is the destination IP address. If there is a warning icon next to it, it means that a known malicious IP was detected. Currently, the Talos malicious IP list is supported.  Now click on Show More link next to the Stack Trace  \u0026nbsp; Inspect the Stack Trace from the attack that was blocked.\nAs highlighted below, it confirms a line with \u0026lsquo;org.apache.logging.log4j.core.net.JndiManager.lookup\u0026rsquo;. This information can be used to guide developers to the lines of code that was used to achieve the result of the event.\n\nNext \u0026nbsp; You\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at how you can use Cisco Secure Application for Risk Profiling and Prioritization.\n\n"

You made sure the policy worked as expected. You have done this step well and bought your DevOps and SecOps teams valuable time to plan and implement a permanent remediation method.\n\nLearning Objectives In this lab you will:\n Understand how to prioritize security issues based on the Business Risk Learn how to navigate the CSA dashboards to quickly understand where the key issues are and how to fix them permanently  \nAppDynamics Application Dashboard \u0026nbsp; Use the steps below to navigate to your TeaStore application.\n Click on the Applications tab on the top menu Find your TeaStore application with your lab number in the name and click on its name to open it  \u0026nbsp; Check the current Business Risk Score for your application, and navigate to Cisco Secure Application to check the risk for specific Business Transactions.\n Click the Business Risk button in the Security Health tab on the right side of the page. This will take you to the Business Transactions dashboard in the CSA.  You can, of course, navigate to this dashboard without going through the Application Dashboard, but the latter will give you a full view of your application\u0026rsquo;s health, including current business risk.   Business Transactions Dashboard \u0026nbsp; Use the Business Transactions security dashboard to identify the transactions that are associated with the highest business risk.\n The Daily Highest Business Risk Score Detected shows the Business Risk Score together with the thresholds.\n The Business Risk score is a dynamically calculated value based on a combination of factors, such as the likelihood of exploitation, the impact of the vulnerability on key business transactions, third-party API vulnerabilities, etc. The Business Risk is in Normal state if the score is between 0-330, in a Warning state if between 340-660, and in a Critical state if the score is above 660  Use the search bar and start typing in cartAction. Select the available cartAction business transaction.\n The list of business transactions should now show a single transaction with associated Business Risk Score, number of vulnerabilities, and attacks.  Click the name of the business transaction.\n  \u0026nbsp; Examine the security state of the selected business transaction.\n The Details section on the left displays the Business Risk Factors that make up the Risk Score. The Business Risk Score is composed of several factors related to the business transaction:\n These factors are drawn from integrations to Kenna, Panoptica, and Cisco Talos, taking into account the status and importance of business transactions as configured in AppDynamics:  Vulnerabilities with High Exploitation Risk: vulnerabilities with Kenna score higher than 66 Threat Activity: security events that match known attack types Usage of Unsafe External API: uses external APIs that are unsafe. Important Business Transaction: has a custom name so it might be important to you. Access to Datastore: has access to a data store. Publicly Accessible: is accessible from the Internet.    In the list below the details you will find all the vulnerabilities that are currently present in the business transaction\n Optional You can click on any of these vulnerabilities to explore the vulnerability further, as you did in one of the previous exercises  Select the API Findings tab\n  \u0026nbsp; Investigate which potentially vulnerable third-party API integrations the business transaction uses.\n Select one of the third-party API Findings provided by Panoptica  Identify the problem (TLS version, vulnerability, \u0026hellip;), severity, API endpoint, and from which application tier the API was called. On the right side you will learn how to mitigate this problem.  Click the Show Occurences link.  \u0026nbsp; See all occurrences of the API vulnerability, the endpoints affected, and the description of each issue.\nWith Business Risk Observability (BRO) features, you have learned to focus on the security issues that have the greatest impact on your business.\n\nSummary In this exercise, you learned how to examine a business transaction for security issues and how to focus on the issues that pose the greatest Business Risk to your organization. You also learned how to examine the security details of business transactions and the associated vulnerabilities that may stem from the libraries used or the third-party APIs called by the application. The features you learned in this lab can help your DevOps and AppSec team immensely in deciding where to start and how to prioritize remediation efforts based on the associated business risk.\nWell done again! It was a quick lab but you now have the information for your teams so they can prioritize their remediation efforts.\n\nNext \u0026nbsp; You will take a look at how you can use Cisco Secure Application for Vulnerability Assessment \u0026amp; Remediation.\n\n"

This will immensely help them in deciding where to start from.\nContinuing on in this lab you will:\n Further assess the vulnerabilities that a particular Library carries Suggest ways to permanently remediate this vulnerability Make sure the DevOps Team has the information that helps them in determining how much effort it will take to permanently remediate a vulnerability  \nLibraries Dashboard \u0026nbsp; Use the steps you used previously to navigate to the Secure Application Dashboard if you\u0026rsquo;ve been logged out.\n\u0026nbsp; Next, you will re-examine the Libraries dashboard so that you can communicate to the DevOps team your recommendation and the scope of efforts to remediate these vulnerabilities.\n Click on the Libraries tab on the top menu Select Library from the filter box drop-down  Type in the string log4j-core Select org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.14.0 from the drop-down  The teastore-webui service is the front end UI where your customers order your products and your business can\u0026rsquo;t afford any downtime with this It carries a Risk score of 100 and 10 which is the highest score for both the Kenna and CVSS ranking. See Vulnerability Scoring in Kenna for more details about the scoring mechanism.  It also has a total of four vulnerabilities  Click on this Library (shown below) to explore it further  \u0026nbsp; On the following page you can see the security details for the selected library.\n It shows all the known vulnerabilities that are present in the application Each of the vulnerabilities is shown with it\u0026rsquo;s Kenna Score and CVSS Score The Remediation Candidate column shows the lowest version needed to fix a particular vulnerability  This helps prevent the rest of the application code from breaking when the library is upgraded to a newer major version that might introduce code issues.   With this information in hand, the DevOps team now knows exactly where to start from, which vulnerability to fix first and what is the lowest version of remediation candidate for each of those vulnerabilities. This helps them vastly in planning their remediation efforts and offering a permanent fix without breaking rest of the application.\n\n\u0026nbsp; Optional Clicking on any of those vulnerabilities will display you a similar screen as shown below.\nYou will see the details of this vulnerability with its Kenna Score and CVSS Score. You will also learn when the vulnerability was first discovered and its current status. You have already done something similar in the \u0026lsquo;Attack Detection and Prevention\u0026rsquo; exercise.\n\nSummary Knowledge gained during this lab could be of great help to your DevOps Team when they plan to permanently remediate the vulnerabilities present in the applications. This will ensure they put in minimum efforts and don\u0026rsquo;t take unnecessary risks with the rest of the application code.\n\nNext \u0026nbsp; Let\u0026rsquo;s find out what\u0026rsquo;s next!\n\n"
