## Introduction

The penalty for a security breach is high. A lack of focus on cybersecurity can be incredibly 
damaging to an organization. There is a direct financial impact such as theft of confidential information, 
disruption to trading or even having to repair affected systems all resulting in financial loss. 
Additionally, cybersecurity breaches also cause reputational damage which sometimes has far bigger 
impact than just the financial loss and can be fatal to an organization.

The moment an application is deployed to production, new security holes and zero-day exploits 
make the Application vulnerable despite all the efforts of the pre-production testing. In a siloed 
world where Security Team is focussed on Vulnerabilities and Threats, and App Team is focussed on 
Application Topologies, Savi (Sr. Director, Cyberdefense, Bridge to Possibili-Tea) wondered if it 
was possible to have a Security Solution that could bring multiple teams together and reduce MTTD and 
the MTTR.

## A New Approach

With applications running anywhere, changing constantly, and being unique, Savi needed to take a new 
approach to security. She wanted a solution that offers ‘Inside-Out Security’. It should:

- Be closer to the application runtime
- Continuously evaluate the Application for security
- Share context with different teams based on metrices from Application Performance Monitoring (APM) 
and Business Intelligence (BiQ) and
- Be adaptive for the Application
