## Introduction

Savi (Sr. Director, Cyberdefense, Bridge to Possibili-Tea), is well aware of the penalty for a 
security breach. A lack of focus on cybersecurity can be incredibly damaging to her organization. 
There is a direct economic impact such as theft of confidential information, disruption to trading 
or even having to repair affected systems all resulting in financial loss. Additionally, cybersecurity 
breaches also cause reputational damage which sometimes has far bigger impact than just the financial loss.

Savi can’t get back the time it takes her team to detect and contain an active breach. Rather 
than just saying “I found something at this URL, can you fix it?”, Savi wanted to go to the DevOps 
team with exact data points and tell them – “I found vulnerability CVE–XXXX-XXXXX in the ‘Checkout’ 
Service Tier of the Application ‘TeaStore’; here is the details of the vulnerability with adversary 
tactics and techniques; this is how bad (severe) it is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring 
System (CVSS) score; this is the likelihood of exploitation based on real-time events (Kenna); you can 
prioritize remediations based on the impact a vulnerability has on important business transactions,
and here are the remediation steps.” This kind of information can be a huge time  saver for the DevOps team.

Savi and her team want to work and solve the following pain points:

- Reduce the time to detection from days/months to minutes
- Protect the application against attacks in real time
- Identify vulnerabilities and threats within the applications in production and suggest suitable
remediation steps
- Reduce the attack surface by collaborating efficiently with other teams to fix the vulnerabilities
and mitigate the threats
- To share the security context that will help in prioritizing remediation tasks based on business impact
