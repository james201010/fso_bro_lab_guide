## Introduction

Benefitting from the last lab 'Business Risk Profiling and Prioritization', you are now aware of the vulnerability that poses the highest risk to your business. This would allow you to suggest the library that should be replaced first.

<br>

## Learning Objectives

You now pass the information gathered during the last lab on to your DevOps Team. This will immensely help them in deciding where to start from. 

Continuing on in this lab you will: 

1. Further assess the vulnerabilities that a particular Library carries
2. Suggest ways to permanently remediate this vulnerability
3. Make sure the DevOps Team has the information that helps them in determining how much effort it will take to permanently remediate a vulnerability

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; Now, let's' explore the **Libraries** dashboard again so you can provide your recommendation and level of effort to remediate these vulnerabilities to the DevOps Team.

1. Click on the **Libraries** tab on the top menu
2. Select **Library** from the filter box drop-down
   - Type in the string **log4j-core**
   - Select **org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.14.0** from the drop-down
3. The **teastore-webui** service is the front end UI **where your customers order your products** and your business can't afford any downtime with this
4. It carries a **Risk score of 100 and 10** which is the highest score for both the **Kenna and CVSS** ranking
   - It also has a total of **four vulnerabilities** 
5. **Click on this Library** (shown below) to explore it further

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; Let's look at the following information viewing the details screen for the library.

1. It shows all the known vulnerabilities that are present in the application
2. Each of the vulnerabilities is shown with it's **Kenna Score** and **CVSS Score** 
3. The **Remediation Candidate** column shows the lowest version needed to fix a particular vulnerability
   - This helps to prevent the rest of the application code from breaking unnecessarily by upgrading the library **too high** just while dealing with a security issue

![image](/images/20_hands_on/assess_remediate_02.png)

With this information in hand, the DevOps team now knows exactly where to start from, which vulnerability to fix first and what is the lowest version of remediation candidate for each of those vulnerabilities. This helps them vastly in planning their remediation efforts and offering a permanent fix without breaking rest of the application.

Based on the above screen, here is your recommendation to the DevOps Team -

**(#2)** "Tier1 service is the bread and butter of our business and your business can't afford any downtime with this. 
It carries a Risk score of 33.1 which is the highest and has a total of four vulnerabilities 
including two with 'Critical' severity level. This should be considered while deciding and prioritizing 
your remediation efforts."

DevOps Team have accepted your recommendation and want to know the efforts needed to remediate 
these vulnerabilities.

In order to give them some more data points, in the **search box**, select **'Existing Libraries'** 
from the **Drop Down** Menu and search for **'log4j-core'** (shown below) **(#1)**. 

![alt text for screen readers](/images/24/existing-libraries.png)

**(#2)** This displays the Library you searched for, Type of Application (Java in this case), Application(s) (Log4Shell)
and Tiers that uses this library (Tier1) and the number of affected Nodes (1). We already had limited 
the scope to one application Log4Shell (Top Right Corner) **(#3)**.

We have talked about this during the last lab but just for the reference, you see there are a total of 
four vulnerabilities in this library - two are 'Critical' **(#4)**.

**Click on this Library** (shown above) to explore it further. You see the following screen. You have 
a lot more detail about the Library now -

![alt text for screen readers](/images/24/library-details.png)

It shows all the known vulnerabilities **(#1)** that are present in the 
application Log4Shell. Each of the vulnerabilities is shown with it's Severity Level **(#2)**, 
Impact Score and the respective Remediation Candidate version **(#3)**. It is the recommended version 
of the Library that can be used for remediation.

The **'Remediation Candidate'** column (#3 above) shows the lowest version needed to fix a particular 
vulnerability. This helps to prevent the rest of the application code from breaking unnecessarily 
by upgrading the library "too high" just while dealing with a security issue.

With this information in hand, the DevOps team now knows exactly where to start from, which vulnerability 
to fix first and what is the lowest version of remediation candidate for each of those vulnerabilities. 
This helps them vastly in planning their remediation efforts and offering a permanent fix without 
breaking rest of the application.

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; **Optional** Clicking on any of those vulnerabilities will display you a similar screen as shown below.

You see the details about that vulnerability with it's **Kenna Score** and **CVSS Score**. You also learn when it was detected first and what it's current status is. We did talk about all this while doing the lab 'Attack Detection and Prevention'.

## Summary

Knowledge gained during this lab could be of great help to your DevOps Team when they plan to permanently remediate the vulnerabilities present in the applications. This will ensure they put in minimum efforts and don't take unnecessary risks with the rest of the application code.
