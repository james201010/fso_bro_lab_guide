 Ali wants to secure his application against the log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability that can result in remote code execution giving complete control over the application and underlying system.

To achieve the above, we will take Ali through the following steps:

1. Access Business Risk Profile
2. Detect if the vulnerability (log4j CVE-2021-44228) is actually present in the application
3. If it is, block the attacks without even updating the code or restarting the app
4. Making sure the attacks were being blocked
5. Further investigating the attacks and the related vulnerability across all tiers of the application
6. Suggesting ways for a permanent remediation for this vulnerability
